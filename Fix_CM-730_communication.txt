 UART settings and latency
By default FTDI chips impose a 16 ms USB latency timer (they buffer data and wait up to 16 ms before
 sending a packet). For real-time control this is often too slow. Set the latency to 1 ms. 
 For example, run: 

echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer

 (This must be done each time the device is re-plugged, or automate via a udev rule.) Lowering the latency
 can dramatically improve throughput: it reduces the response latency from ~16 ms to ~1 ms .The
 Robotis Dynamixel SDK discussion notes that enabling ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY on Linux makes communication 
 “16 times faster” by dropping the latency from 16 ms to 1 ms .
To automate this, you can add a udev rule 

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-dynamixelsdk-usb.rules

with content: 

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb-serial", DRIVER=="ftdi_sio", ATTR{latency_timer}
 ="1"

 and reload udev 

 sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
 
After this,the latency will be set to 1 ms automatically upon device attach
